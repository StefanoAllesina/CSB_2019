## ECEV 32000 Summaries and Warmup Exercises

### General goals for the class

- Learn how to automate analysis of biological data
- Program in different languages
- Integrate different tools into coherent "pipelines"
- Find out about tools that you didn't consider before
- Jumpstart the learning of anything computer-related

### Method

- Lecture notes/book
- Exercises in class and homework
- You need to include these tools into your daily work to be effective
- "Showcase" more than "Teach"
- Give practical examples
- Brief review of the chapter(s) for the week
- Warmup exercises
- Working as a group to solve the longer exercises at the end of the chapter

### Final project

- Take a boring task (or complicated one) and automate it
- Good examples: automatically process data from experimental apparatus; image analysis; automated reporting of experimental results; downloading and organizing data from websites; ...
- A [great example](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/10/115816) and associated  [code](http://ciliate.org/index.php/show/CDH)
- You can collaborate (but tackle a larger problem, and document who did what)
- Remember to include: a) Report; b) Code; c) Working example. Ideally, just send me the link to a public repo.
